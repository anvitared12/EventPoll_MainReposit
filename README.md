## EventPoll — Live Event Polling Platform

EventPoll is a real-time event polling platform designed for organisers and participants. It allows event hosts to create polls instantly and enables users to join and vote from their devices during live events.

The platform focuses on providing:
- Fast and reliable live updates
- Easy poll creation and management for organisers
- Simple participation experience for users
- Real-time result visualization

It consists of three major components:
- **Organiser App** — used to create and manage polls.
- **User App** — used by participants to join a poll and submit votes.
- **Signaling Server** — handles real-time communication and updates between clients using sockets.

The system is suitable for:
- Live events
- Classrooms and workshops
- Conferences and meetups
- Audience engagement activities

The goal of this project is to make audience interaction instant, simple, and engaging by eliminating delays in collecting and displaying responses.
